description: "The Tale of Ginger and Pickles (originally, Ginger and Pickles) is a\
  \ children's book written and illustrated by Beatrix Potter, and first published\
  \ by Frederick Warne & Co. in 1909. The book tells of two shopkeepers who extend\
  \ unlimited credit to their customers and, as a result, are forced to go out of\
  \ business. It was originally published in a large format which permitted Potter\
  \ the opportunity to lavish great detail on the illustrations and also allowed her\
  \ to include black-and-white vignettes. Potter filled the tale with characters from\
  \ her previous books. The book was eventually republished in the standard small\
  \ format of the Peter Rabbit series and was adapted to drama in 1931.\n From Wikipedia\
